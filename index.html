      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Yoganandh</strong>, a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Michigan State University. My research explores the fascinating world of nonlinear acoustic wave propagation in inhomogeneous and layered media, combining theoretical modeling, numerical simulation, and experimental validation to solve real-world challenges in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE).

Beyond the equations and lab work, I’m passionate about using science and engineering as tools for understanding, innovation, and impact. Whether it's developing novel techniques to characterize internal stresses in advanced materials or designing more efficient simulation workflows, my goal is to bridge theory and application in ways that serve both industry and society.

I thrive at the intersection of acoustics, structural dynamics, and data-driven modeling, and I’m deeply interested in how these disciplines can inform areas like material science, healthcare diagnostics, sustainable manufacturing, and infrastructure safety. I’m also inspired by the potential of interdisciplinary research, and I'm enthusiastic about collaboration—especially where engineering meets education, policy, or public service.

Previously, as a System Modeling Engineer at Eaton Corporation, I applied my skills to vehicle dynamics and NVH optimization, gaining a practical appreciation for how modeling, design, and innovation come together in the product lifecycle. My journey has taught me that curiosity, empathy, and perseverance are just as important as technical skill.

Outside of research, I enjoy mentoring, engaging in science communication, and exploring how emerging technologies—like Physics-Informed Neural Networks and AI-enhanced modeling—can transform traditional engineering.

Let’s connect if you share interests in acoustics, simulation, sustainable tech, or just the joy of figuring things out.</p>
