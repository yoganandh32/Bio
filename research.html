  <h2>Inversion of Acoustic Nonlinearity Using Immersion Ultrasound</h2>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px;">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
      <p>
        This work presents a novel inversion-based method to measure the absolute acoustic nonlinearity parameter (β) of solids using immersion ultrasonic testing. The technique eliminates the need for tedious transducer calibration typical in contact-based approaches by employing a through-transmission setup in a water-solid-water configuration. A new theoretical model was developed to account for nonlinear wave propagation, diffraction, and attenuation across multiple layers. The model was validated with experiments on fused silica and applied to determine the β of rolled aluminum (AL1100) along different material directions. The results showed good agreement with existing literature and contact-based techniques, demonstrating the method’s potential for reliable, repeatable, and non-contact characterization of material nonlinearity.

      <h2>Acoustic Imaging for Material Characterization of Welded Samples</h2>
      <img src="images/acoustic-imaging.jpg" alt="Welded Material Acoustic Image" />
      <p>We used ultrasonic C-scan and immersion testing to evaluate weld quality in metallic samples. The project aimed to identify porosity, lack of fusion, and inclusions using acoustic contrast.</p>
